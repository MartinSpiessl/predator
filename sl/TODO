o  join of states ... example:
   - input: empty | 1 node | SLS 0+ | SLS 1+
   - output: SLS 0+

o  get ready for hlist_head/hlist_node from <linux/list.h>, now we can handle
   only list_head based lists

o  explicit isomorphism in symstate and cut-points based split/join algorithms

o  We should be able to cover small lists (of length 0 or 1) by a compatible
   list segment prototype while analyzing the data of a segment candidate.
   First we need to extend DataMatchVisitor, in order allow such abstraction.
   Then we can hook it somewhere in mergeValues().

o  canonical representation of Linux DLSs nested into Linux DLSs

o  make some driver analysis run
