o  join of states ... example:
   - input: empty | 1 node | SLS 0+ | SLS 1+
   - output: SLS 0+

o  aliasing of a field with zero offset with pointer to the surrounding object

o  explicit initializers of gl variables are completely ignored at the moment

o  symstate: proper comparison of Neq and EqIf predicates (it will require to
   extend the interface of SymHeap if we want to do it enough efficiently)

o FIXME:
  - test0077b: outcast via an incompatible structure; leads to somehow corrupted
    ghost structure in which a "field" edge is strangely replaced by a "pointsTo"
    arc which does not make sense in the given context.
  - jonathan-DLL.c: announces junk, which should not appear.
  - jonathan-skip-list.c: no way for us to manage, but the tool completely crashes,
    which should not happen (dealing with structures such as skip lists is 
    a challenge---of course, the solution should be reasonably general).
