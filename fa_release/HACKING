Avoid trailing white space
==========================

If you use Emacs, customize its font-lock mode (FIXME: provide more detail) or
try one of its whitespace packages.  This appears to be the one that will end up
in emacs 23:

[that page says its version also works with emacs 21 and 22]
If you use vim, add this to ~/.vimrc:

    let c_space_errors=1
    highlight RedundantSpaces ctermbg=red guibg=red
    match RedundantSpaces /\s\+$\| \+\ze\t/


Git can help too, by stopping you from committing any change that would
add trailing blanks.  The example pre-commit hook contains code to check
for trailing whitespace and spaces before tabs; enable it by moving it
to the right place and making sure it is executable:

    mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit

With a repository created by git-1.5.6 or older, use this command:

    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

To manually check for whitespace errors before committing, you can use

    git diff --check

Git also has some settings to enable suitable internal whitespace checks.
See the manpage for git-apply for details.
