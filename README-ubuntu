Building Predator on Ubuntu
===========================
Note I do not use Ubuntu myself, so this howto may become outdated as time
passes by.  Any suggestions from real Ubuntu users on how to improve this howto
are welcome.

    sudo apt-get install cmake curl         \
        libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev  \
        gcc-multilib

    curl http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~idudka/download/predator-2011-10-10-e280e28.tar.gz \
        | gzip -cd \
        | tar x

    cd predator-2011-10-10-e280e28

    make -j3 build_boost build_gcc

    make -j3

    make check


Note you need approximately 2 GB of free disk space to unpack and build GCC.
The steps above were successfully tested on Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop (i386 and
amd64) and Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS (Lucid Lynx).
