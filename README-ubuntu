Building Predator on Ubuntu
===========================
Note I do not use Ubuntu myself, so this howto may become outdated as time
passes by.  Any suggestions from real Ubuntu users on how to improve this howto
are welcome.  Please replace XXXXXX by the latest release of Predator (for
example predator-2011-07-29-d38c348).

    sudo apt-get install cmake curl         \
        libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev  \
        gcc-multilib

    curl http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~idudka/download/XXXXXX.tar.gz \
        | gzip -cd \
        | tar x

    cd XXXXXX

    make -j3 build_boost build_gcc

    make -j3

    make check


The steps above were successfully tested on Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop (i386 and
amd64) and Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS (Lucid Lynx).
