Q: What equipment do I need to compile GCC from SVN sources?
A: * SVN client
     - the executable is called 'svn'
     - usually provided by a package called 'subversion'
     - available at http://subversion.apache.org/

   * GMP library (including the -devel stuff)
     - available at http://gmplib.org/
     - package is usually called 'gmp'
     - on binary distros you may need also the 'gmp-devel' sub-package

   * MPC library (including the -devel stuff)
     - available at http://www.multiprecision.org/
     - package is usually called 'mpc' or 'libmpc'
     - on binary distros you may need also the 'libmpc-devel' sub-package

   * MPFR library (including the -devel stuff)
     - available at http://www.mpfr.org/
     - package is usually called 'mpfr'
     - on binary distros you may need also the 'mpfr-devel' sub-package

Q: What equipment do I need to compile the GCC plug-in?
A: * CMake 2.8+
     - available at http://www.cmake.org
     - the executable is called 'cmake'
     - usually provided by a package called 'cmake'

   * Boost libraries 1.37+
     - available at http://www.boost.org/
     - package is usually called 'boost'
     - on binary distros you may need also the 'boost-devel' sub-package

Q: What equipment do I need to run the test-suite?
A: * 32bit system headers, especially in case of 64bit OS
     - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'libc6-dev-i386'
     - you can check their status
       by 'gcc -m32 -o /dev/null /usr/include/stdlib.h'

Q: How can I compile GCC from SVN sources?
A:
    $ make build_gcc

Q: How can I compile the GCC plug-in?
A:
    $ make -C sl

Q: How can I run the test-suite?
A:
    $ make check

Q: Can I compile the plug-in against my system GCC instead?
A: Yes, you need GCC version 4.5+ or a working snapshot.

Q: How can I compile the plug-in against my system GCC?
A:
    $ ln -sfT GCC_PLUGIN_HEADERS include/gcc
    $ make -C sl

    You need to replace GCC_PLUGIN_HEADERS by a directory containing the gcc
    plug-in headers (gcc-plugin.h, tree-pass.h, and the like).  No idea, if
    there is something like standardized location for them across all
    distributions.  On my box they are located in:

    /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.5.0-alpha20091224/plugin/include

Q: How can I run the test-suite using my system GCC?
A:
    $ make check CMAKE="cmake -D GCC45=gcc-4.5.0-alpha20091224"

    You need to replace gcc-4.5.0-alpha20091224 by either absolute path to your
    gcc executable, or a ralative one to $PATH.

Q: How can I run the test-suite in parallel?
A:
    $ make check CTEST="ctest -j9"
